# DermAI: AI-Powered Early Detection of Skin Cancer

## Entry Point
The **entry point for this project** is the `UI Notebook` (`ui_notebook.ipynb`). This notebook provides the user-facing interface where users can upload images, receive predictions, and interact with the model. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the required models and configurations are loaded before running.

## Description of Included Resources
1. **UI Notebook (`ui_notebook.ipynb`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Main entry point for the project, providing an interactive front-end for users.
   - **Key Features**: Image upload, real-time predictions, feedback mechanisms.

2. **Image Classifier Notebook (`Image_classifier_VivekHiremath.ipynb`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Develop and train the core machine learning model using CNNs for image classification.
   - **Usage**: Used during the initial training phase to prepare the classification model.

3. **Inference Notebook (`Inference_Notebook.ipynb`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Perform inference using the trained model. This notebook handles prediction generation and reasoning outputs.
   - **Usage**: Deploy the trained model for real-world predictions.

4. **Playground Notebook (`Playground_VivekHiremath.ipynb`)**:
   - **Purpose**: A sandbox environment for testing new ideas, debugging, and prototype enhancements.
   - **Usage**: Iterate on new ideas or refine model configurations.
