# DermAI: AI Model for Early Skin Cancer Detection

## Project Overview

**DermAI** is an AI-driven solution aimed at supporting early detection of skin cancer using low-quality images captured with smartphones. The tool is designed to assist underserved populations with limited access to specialized dermatological care. By analyzing images and descriptions, DermAI can classify skin lesions as benign or malignant and provide insights to help triage patients who may need in-person consultations with dermatologists.

## Project Scope

The scope of DermAI includes:

- **Image and Text Analysis**: Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing lesion descriptions.
- **Prediction Transparency**: Offering explanations to provide transparency around the AI’s predictions.
- **Teledermatology Assistance**: Triaging individuals who may require further medical consultation based on the AI's assessment.

## Key Considerations

In developing and deploying DermAI, we plan to take into account several critical factors:

- **Trustworthiness**: Ensuring fairness, transparency, and bias mitigation in the model’s predictions.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Implementing measures for data encryption and HIPAA compliance, as this project deals with sensitive medical information.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Using cloud resources (e.g., AWS Sagemaker) for scalability and optimizing for performance across various environments.
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Following ethical AI standards, including continuous review and stakeholder engagement, to ensure that the project aligns with healthcare needs.

## AI Techniques & Tools

- **CNNs for Image Classification**
- **NLP for Text Analysis**
- **Explainable AI**: Implementing techniques like SHAP for prediction transparency.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Using libraries such as Fairlearn and AI360.
